See
[here](https://stephenslab.github.io/single-cell-jamboree/lps.html)
for some background on the LPS data set, as well as the steps taken to
prepare the (bulk) RNA-seq counts for analysis with flashier.

Load the packages used in the code below.

```{r load-pkgs, message=FALSE}
library(flashier)
library(ggplot2)
library(cowplot)
```

Set the seed for reproducibility:

```{r set-seed}
set.seed(1)
```

Load the LPS data:

```{r load-data}
load("data/lps.RData")
```
